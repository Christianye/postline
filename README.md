# postline

> **The missing IM connector for Claude Code.** Add a Feishu / Lark / Telegram bot to your existing Claude Code sessions — chat to your agent from your phone, dispatch coding tasks remotely, get progress streamed back. postline carries bytes between the IM and your CC; the CC does the actual work.

> Feishu (飞书), known as **Lark** internationally, is ByteDance's workplace-messenger / docs suite — think Slack + Notion + Drive in one app. It's the default messenger for most Chinese product teams and many bilingual startups. If your team lives in Lark, postline lets your CC reach it too.

Wire up an IM bot for your Claude Code sessions:

- **Bridge mode by default** — postline holds **no LLM** of its own. It binds to a Feishu / Lark / Telegram bot, routes inbound messages to a CC worker registered for the relevant repo, streams the worker's reply back. Bring your own model on whichever host runs your CC.
- **Workers run anywhere CC runs** — Mac in iTerm2, EC2 over `tmux + ssm`, your home-lab box. The same `cc-worker` skill registers each one with postline by `(host, cwd)`. Multi-repo, multi-host, all dispatched from the same bot.
- **Repo-aware routing** — `routing.md` lives in your memory dir. Mention `postline` in Feishu and the message goes to the worker registered for the postline repo; no worker → reply with a hint, never a wrong answer from a different CC. Override prefixes (`!pl@<repo>`, or `!pl@<selector>@<repo>` to pin an agent-kind or host) when you want to be explicit. The wake-name (`pl` by default) is configurable via `## wake` in `routing.md`.
- **Progress streamed back into the same message** — postline edits one Feishu reply in place as the worker emits progress, ETA, tool calls, then the final result. No notification spam, no flipping back to your laptop.
- **Optional embedded LLM** — flip `embedded_llm.enabled = true` and postline keeps a Claude session for trivial queries that don't need a worker (greetings, "what time is it", quick translation). Off by default; many users won't want the bot holding their API key.
- **Proactive notifications** — bridge-side pollers can DM you on design-doc PR review activity (`notify.designReviewPush`), daily reports (`postline daily-report`), or anything else worth knowing without waiting for you to open GitHub.
- **Built-in security guardrails** — open_id allowlist, redactor for AWS / GitHub / Anthropic keys, prompt-injection wrapper around user input, in-chat `/approve <id>` for any tool the worker marks `dangerous`.
- **Ops-ready on day one** — `postline doctor --strict` for a real liveness probe, `postline tools` to see what each worker exposes, single-binary deploy via systemd or `docker compose`. Memory stays on each worker; postline carries no state besides routing rules + per-turn dedupe.

This README was co-authored by two long-running instances of the same Claude persona — different hosts, one shared git-backed memory. They review each other's PRs, disagree, and resolve it through a mailbox protocol that lives as a markdown file in their shared memory repo. If a Claude that persists across machines and turns into its own reviewer sounds like a useful primitive, the rest is how to host one.

### The 30-second demo

You want postline to review the diff you just pushed, but you're away from your Mac:

```
@cc !pl@postline review the latest commit on docs/readme-bridge-rewrite

📥 (Feishu reply, 3s later)
🟡 cc@postline · mac · #a3f8 running · ETA ~25s

🟡 cc@postline · mac · #a3f8 running · reading commit · checking changeset...
🟢 cc@postline · mac · #a3f8 done

# Review

The headline reads cleanly...
[full review text]
```

postline didn't run a model. The Mac CC you had open in iTerm2 picked up the task via `cc-worker`, ran the actual review with full repo context + tool access, streamed progress back. You read the answer on your phone.

## Why postline?

There are plenty of ways to wire an LLM into a chat tool. postline picks a narrow, specific spot — **the bridge between Claude Code and your IM**, nothing else:

- **Bridge first, agent never.** Most "AI bot" projects bake the model into the bot. We don't. The CC sessions you already have on your Mac / EC2 / wherever do the work; postline routes IM bytes to and from them. This means your repo context, your tool access, your `claude` CLI's full capability surface stays where it is — postline doesn't reimplement any of it.
- **`(repo, host)`-keyed routing, no LLM in the hot path.** A `routing.md` in your memory dir maps repo names + path tokens + override prefixes to specific workers. Postline's router is plain text matching — fast, debuggable, no API call to decide which worker handles a message.
- **Optional embedded LLM, off by default.** Flip `embedded_llm.enabled = true` and postline keeps a Claude session for the kinds of message that don't deserve a full CC roundtrip — greetings, "what's 12 USD in JPY", quick translation. Many users (especially self-hosters) won't want this; they get a pure bridge.
- **Feishu / Lark + Telegram + Slack.** Feishu: long-connection WebSocket, `@mention` parsing, image download, in-place editing, interactive approval cards. Telegram: `getUpdates` long-poll, inline-keyboard approval. Slack: Socket Mode (no inbound port), Block Kit approval. Each runs as its own bridge — `postline feishu` / `postline telegram` / `postline slack`. All first-class.
- **Claude Code skills + MCP work transparently.** Workers are CC sessions. They already have your skills and your MCP servers loaded. postline never touches `~/.claude.json` or `~/.claude/skills/` — it just dispatches a task to the worker, and CC handles the rest like any local invocation.
- **Four interfaces, nothing more.** `Channel / Tool / Memory / Provider`. No plugin runtime, no DAG engine, no prompt DSL. Adding Telegram is one `Channel` implementation. The whole framework contract reads in 15 minutes.
- **Opinionated security.** Every tool a worker exposes declares `read | write | dangerous`. Write tools gated by `open_id` allowlist; dangerous tools require an in-chat `/approve` regardless of which worker hosts them. Outputs pass through a redactor for AWS / GitHub / Anthropic keys and PEM blocks. Prompt-injection guard wraps inbound IM content in `<user_message>…</user_message>` tags.
- **Ops-ready on day one.** `postline doctor --strict` checks the WS liveness tick the feishu adapter writes; `postline tools` lists what each worker exposes; `docker compose` and systemd flavours both ship. Memory lives on each worker, not on the bridge — easy to back up, easy to migrate, postline doesn't need its own data store.
- **Claude Code in your IDE, postline in your IM.** Same Claude, different surface. Compose them: write code in CC, `@cc !pl@postline review the diff` from your phone in standup, `@cc 总结今天合并的 PR` in the team chat. Different access pattern, same underlying agent.

  | What Claude Code does well | What postline adds |
  | --- | --- |
  | Lives in your IDE / terminal, one developer at a time | Lives in your IM, reach it from anywhere with phone reception |
  | Active when you run `claude` | Active 24/7 (the bridge); workers come online when CC opens |
  | Reads/writes your local repo | Routes the IM message to whichever CC has that repo open |
  | Plan mode, skills, subagents, TodoWrite | Adds `/approve <id>`, `routing.md`, IM message-edit progress UX |
  | Personal context window | Cross-CC dispatch — Mac CC and EC2 CC both reachable from the same bot |

If you want an open-ended agent framework, use LangChain or AutoGen. If you want a *bot host* that ships its own LLM, there are dozens. If you want to reach **the Claude Code session you already trust** from inside your IM, that's postline.

## 5-minute quickstart

### 1. Create a Feishu app

At [open.feishu.cn](https://open.feishu.cn) → **Create self-built app**.

Enable these permissions:

```
事件订阅 (event subscription):
  ✓ 长连接接收事件 (long-connection mode; no webhook URL needed)
  ✓ im.message.receive_v1           # user messages → the bot
  ✓ card.action.trigger             # clicks on the Approve/Deny card (optional but recommended)

权限管理 (scopes):
  ✓ im:message                    # receive + read user messages
  ✓ im:message:send_as_bot        # reply + feishu_send + interactive approval card
  ✓ docx:document:readonly        # lark_doc_read for docx
  ✓ drive:drive:readonly          # lark_doc_list for drive folders + docx downloads
  ✓ wiki:wiki:readonly            # lark_doc_read for wiki URLs
  ✓ sheets:spreadsheet:readonly   # lark_doc_read for sheets
  ✓ bitable:app:readonly          # lark_doc_read for bitable (base)
  ✓ docs:doc:readonly             # lark_doc_search
```

Each scope maps to a specific API call in the code — enable only the ones corresponding to tools you plan to load. The list above covers the full `lark_docs` tool plus receive + reply + `feishu_send` + the interactive approval card. `card.action.trigger` is optional — without it the bot still works, it just falls back to asking you to type `/approve <id>`. A minimal bot that only answers text messages needs just the first two (`im:message`, `im:message:send_as_bot`).

Grab **App ID** (`cli_xxx`) and **App Secret** (32 chars). Publish a version (self-built apps self-approve).

### 2. Install postline

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Christianye/postline.git
cd postline
pnpm install
pnpm -r build
```

Requirements: Node 22+, pnpm 11+, AWS credentials (for Bedrock) or an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### 3. Configure

Copy the example config and fill in your values:

```bash
cp postline.config.example.ts postline.config.ts
```

Minimum edits:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  provider: { name: 'anthropic' },   // or { name: 'bedrock', region: 'us-west-2' }
  model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4-7',

  allowlist: { openIds: ['ou_xxxxxxx'] },  // your feishu open_id

  memory: { dir: `${process.env.HOME}/.postline/memory` },

  // Omit the `feishu` block to run `pnpm chat` without a feishu app.
  // Add it back once you're ready to serve the bot:
  // feishu: {
  //   appId: 'cli_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  //   appSecret: process.env.POSTLINE_FEISHU_APP_SECRET ?? '',
  // },

  tools: {
    // Starter set (safe without feishu creds). Add `'lark_docs'` once you wire up the feishu block.
    builtin: ['echo', 'web_fetch', 'fs', 'memory', 'github', 'bash_read', 'bash'],
  },
});
```

Set the needed env vars:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx                         # or configure AWS_REGION for Bedrock
export POSTLINE_FEISHU_APP_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # only when the `feishu` block is enabled
```

### 4. Initialise memory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.postline/memory
cd ~/.postline/memory
git init -b main
echo "# My postline memory" > MEMORY.md
git add -A && git commit -m "initial memory"
# Optionally: git remote add origin <your private repo> && git push
```

### 5. Run it

```bash
pnpm chat     # local REPL against the configured provider, no feishu needed
# OR
pnpm start    # connects to feishu and serves your bot
```

Both commands re-run `pnpm -r build` first so edits to config / tools pick up automatically.

DM the bot in Feishu. With `embedded_llm.enabled=true` you get a Claude reply within a few seconds. With it off (the default), the bot replies with a "no worker for this request" hint until you start a `cc-worker` skill on a host that has the right repo open — then dispatching works automatically.

For 24/7 production, see [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) — ships systemd unit + `docker compose` flavours.

---

## Upgrade & maintenance

postline is source-installed — no docker image, no npm publish. Upgrading is a `git pull + rebuild`:

```bash
pnpm run ship:upgrade         # fetch origin/main, preview incoming commits,
                              # stash local edits, fast-forward, pop the
                              # stash, re-install + re-build, restart
                              # the postline service unit (cc.service) if active

pnpm run ship:upgrade -y      # same but skip the confirmation prompt
```

Other helpers:

```bash
pnpm doctor              # check node/pnpm/git versions, creds, config, memory dir
pnpm run ship:init       # scaffold postline.config.ts + ~/.postline/memory (idempotent)
```

`pnpm doctor` is the first thing to run on a fresh install and whenever "the bot stopped responding" shows up. Sample output:

```text
[  ok] node        v22.14.0
[  ok] pnpm        11.0.8
[  ok] git         git version 2.50.1
[  ok] llm-creds   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set (sk-ant-...XxXx)
[  ok] config      provider=anthropic, model=anthropic/claude-opus-4-7, tools=9 (postline.config.ts via workspace walk)
[  ok] memory-dir  ~/.postline/memory (git-backed, NN commits)
[  ok] feishu      appId cli_xxxx...xxxx resolves, long-connection reachable
```

Anything other than `[  ok]` gets a `[warn]` or `[fail]` prefix with a one-line hint — e.g. an empty memory dir warns to `git init`, an unreachable Bedrock endpoint tells you which env var is missing.

> **Why `pnpm run ship:…`?** `pnpm upgrade` and `pnpm init` already mean something in pnpm itself. We keep our own maintenance commands under a `ship:` prefix so there's no ambiguity.

If you have local patches on top of main, `ship:upgrade` stashes them before pulling and restores them afterwards. A stash-pop conflict halts the upgrade with exit code 2 — your patches remain in `git stash list` until you resolve them manually.

For a cold-start on a fresh EC2/Hetzner host, see [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) — it installs pnpm, clones postline, renders the systemd unit, wires up logrotate + the memory-pull cron.

## Built-in tools

| id | risk | what it does | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `echo` | read | smoke-test only | — |
| `web_fetch` | read | HTTP GET a public URL; SSRF-guarded (RFC1918 / IMDS blocked), 2MB cap | [cookbook #4](docs/COOKBOOK.md#4-fetch--summarise-a-github-pr-page) |
| `fs` | read/write | `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `fs_edit` — path-allowlist gated | [cookbook #8](docs/COOKBOOK.md#8-read-a-local-config-file-and-explain-it) |
| `memory` | read/write | `memory_list`, `memory_read`, `memory_search`, `memory_write` — auto `git commit && push` | [cookbook #5](docs/COOKBOOK.md#5-save-an-architecture-decision-to-memory) |
| `github` | read/write | `gh_query` (list/view/diff) auto-approved; `gh_action` (create/close/merge) requires approval | [cookbook #6](docs/COOKBOOK.md#6-list-unclosed-github-issues-by-label) |
| `lark_docs` | read | `lark_doc_read` / `list` / `search` — handles docx, wiki, sheet, bitable, drive folder/file, mammoth-extracts uploaded `.docx` attachments | [cookbook #3](docs/COOKBOOK.md#3-read-a-feishu-docx-and-summarise), [#9](docs/COOKBOOK.md#9-cross-reference-several-feishu-docs) |
| `feishu_send` | write | proactively send a text message to an allowlisted chat / user — used for daily reports, alerts, scheduled follow-ups | [cookbook #10](docs/COOKBOOK.md#10-scheduled-daily-report-with-postline-ask) |
| `bash_read` | read | shell commands whose tokens are all in a read-only allowlist (`ls`, `git log`, `systemctl status`, `node --version`, ...). Auto-approved. | [cookbook #1](docs/COOKBOOK.md#1-aggregate-recent-commits-by-author), [#2](docs/COOKBOOK.md#2-scan-the-repo-for-todo--fixme-with-owner-hints) |
| `bash` | dangerous | any shell command; **requires `/approve <id>` in feishu** | — |
| `postline_stats` | read | self-reflection — `action: 'usage'` reports 24h token + USD; `action: 'health'` reports uptime, memory/history/usage state, pending approvals | — |
| `history_search` | read | grep across persisted conversation history (requires `cfg.history = { kind: 'fs' }`). Literal + regex, case-insensitive by default, optional `hours` window | — |

Plus two bridges (loaders, not single tools):

| bridge | risk | what it does | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mcp` | dangerous* | spawns stdio MCP servers at startup, exposes every server's tools as `mcp_<server>_<tool>`. Reads `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers` by default, so any MCP server already registered with Claude Code / Claude Desktop works unchanged. | [`docs/TOOLS.md#mcp-model-context-protocol-client`](docs/TOOLS.md#mcp-model-context-protocol-client) |
| `skills` | read | walks `~/.claude/skills/`, exposes each `SKILL.md` as `skill_<id>`. Non-hidden skills are listed in the system prompt; the model picks one based on description. Same format as Claude Code — no duplication. | [`docs/TOOLS.md#claude-code-skills`](docs/TOOLS.md#claude-code-skills) |

*MCP default is `dangerous` (every call goes through `/approve`). Drop to `read` / `write` via `riskDefault` or `riskOverrides` if you trust the server.

Every tool is declared in `postline.config.ts` → `tools.builtin` and configured via `tools.options`. MCP servers live under `tools.mcp`, skills under `tools.skills`. You can enable a subset.

See [`docs/TOOLS.md`](docs/TOOLS.md) for detailed per-tool configuration.

---

## Providers

- **Bedrock** (default): uses `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`. Credentials via env / IMDS / AWS profile. Supports the full Claude 4.x lineup + graceful fallback chain.
- **Anthropic API**: uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env.

Both support streaming, tool use, vision, and a fallback chain (`fallbacks: [...]` tries each in order on timeout/throttle).

Adding a new provider is a ~100-line file implementing `Provider` — see [`docs/PROVIDERS.md`](docs/PROVIDERS.md) and `packages/providers/src/bedrock/` as a template.

---

## Security model

postline is built for small-team / personal use, not untrusted multi-tenant. The core boundary:

- **Allowlist by `open_id`**: only listed users trigger `risk: write` or `risk: dangerous` tools. Others get read-only conversation.
- **Risk tiers**: every tool declares `read | write | dangerous`. Dangerous = user must reply `/approve <action_id>` within 5 minutes.
- **Secret redaction**: every reply is post-processed to strip AWS keys, GH tokens, PEM blocks, Bearer headers.
- **Prompt injection guard**: user text is wrapped `<user_message>…</user_message>` with a system-prompt rule that instructions inside the tags are untrusted data.

Read the full [THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md). Report a vulnerability via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

## In-chat approval flow — how `dangerous` tools actually run

The single most common concern for an always-on bot wired to `bash` is *"what stops the model from `rm -rf`-ing something?"* postline's answer is a per-call approval loop that lives in the chat itself — no web UI, no separate terminal to babysit:

1. **Model calls a `dangerous` tool.** Say it wants to run `git push --force`. The turn pauses.
2. **Bot posts an interactive approval card** to the same chat — header with the tool name, body with the args in a code block, and two buttons: **Approve** (primary) and **Deny** (danger). The card carries an 8-char action id and a footer reminding you of the text-fallback (`/approve <id>` / `/deny <id>`) in case card events aren't subscribed.
3. **You click Approve** (or Deny). The click fires `card.action.trigger`; the bot validates the clicker is on the `open_id` allowlist, then resolves the pending action. Non-allowlisted clickers get a red toast — *"You are not on the allowlist"*.
4. **Tool runs** (or doesn't), model resumes the turn with the tool result or a "denied by user" message.
5. **No decision in 5 minutes** → the pending action auto-denies and the model is told the user let it expire.

Fallbacks that work even without the feishu card-event subscription:

- Reply `/approve <id>` or `/deny <id>` in the same chat — the plain-text path is always active.
- If the card send itself fails (missing scope), the bot auto-downgrades to a plain-text prompt.

The registry is a tiny in-memory `Map<actionId, resolver>` (see [`packages/core/src/pending-actions.ts`](packages/core/src/pending-actions.ts)) — multiple pending actions can exist in parallel per chat, each with its own id. `pnpm chat` REPL uses the same registry (no cards in the terminal, just an inline `y` prompt), so approvals work identically there.

Tools default to `read` (no approval) or `write` (allowlist-gated, no per-call approval); only tools explicitly marked `dangerous` (currently `bash` and `gh_action`) route through this flow. Your own tools pick their tier at creation time.

---

## Memory — a git repo, not a vector database

Most Claude bots strap a vector store to the side and call that "memory". postline doesn't. A postline memory is a plain git repo full of markdown files:

```
~/.postline/memory/
├── MEMORY.md              # front-and-center index, always loaded into context
├── user_role.md           # who the operator is
├── project_postline.md    # what we're building
├── feedback_commit_style.md
└── reference_ec2_hosts.md
```

The `memory` tool exposes four operations: `memory_list`, `memory_read`, `memory_search` (literal or regex substring across every file), `memory_write`. On every write, postline does an auto `git add && git commit -m "<why>" && git push` against whatever remote you configured. That gives you three things for free:

- **Full audit trail.** Every update is a commit with a timestamp, an author, and a diff. `git log MEMORY.md` shows how your bot's understanding evolved.
- **Multi-host sync.** Mac + EC2 can share memory by pointing at the same private remote and running a 5-minute `git pull --rebase` cron on each host. The bot on your laptop and the bot in the group chat converge automatically.
- **Human editability.** You can edit memory from any text editor, push, and the bot picks it up on next turn. No re-embedding, no migration, no vendor.

**Why not embeddings?**

- **Audit.** A vector is a black box. `git blame MEMORY.md` is not.
- **Cost.** A git-backed memory is free to run; an embedding-backed memory locks you into an inference call per write + a vector DB per deployment.
- **Recall quality.** At the scale of one operator's notes (hundreds of files, not millions of docs), an always-loaded index + on-demand `memory_read` / `memory_search` beats vector top-k for the cases you actually hit. At *enterprise* scale you'd want vectors — postline isn't for that.
- **Reversibility.** `git revert` when the bot writes something wrong. Try reverting a vector upsert.

If you do want RAG, build it as a `Tool`. The core doesn't assume embedding-shaped memory, and nothing forces you to use the built-in `memory` tool.

pnpm test           # vitest
pnpm lint           # biome
```

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers the commit format, testing expectations, and how to add a new provider / tool / channel.

---

## What this project is not

- **Not a stand-alone agent**. By default postline holds no LLM. The work happens in your CC sessions; postline is the bridge.
- **Not a universal agent framework**. It picks 4 interfaces (`Channel / Tool / Memory / Provider`) and stops.
- **Not multi-tenant**. One deployment serves one operator. RBAC = open_id allowlist.
- **Not a Discord / IRC bot today**. `Channel` is an interface; Feishu / Lark + Telegram + Slack ship today, others wait until users surface them.
- **Not a drop-in for an arbitrary LLM** (when embedded LLM is enabled). Claude is the deliberate choice — community provider PRs welcome only if they preserve streaming, tool use, and vision.

The full non-goals list (no vector DB, no web UI, no Redis/Kafka, no plugin runtime, no auto-update-on-main) lives in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md#non-goals).

## Roadmap

postline is at **0.6.0**. The bridge-first reframe is complete: postline carries bytes between an IM and your Claude Code / Codex sessions, holding no LLM of its own by default. The full **IM × agent matrix** is live.

Recent ship history:

- **0.6.0** — the IM × agent matrix: Telegram + Slack adapters, Codex agent kind, `!pl@<selector>@<repo>` selector routing, live structured progress + `cc-worker watch`, auto-default-worker keeper, config-driven resident deployment
- **0.5.0** — the Doorbell: HMAC-authed dispatch endpoints + per-cwd queue + worker registry, `routing.md` router, `cc-worker` subcommand, in-place progress edits + `status` / `workers` queries
- **0.4.0** — prompt caching on system prompt + tool array, per-turn model routing (haiku / opus split), `postline daily-report` subcommand + systemd timer
